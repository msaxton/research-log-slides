## Creating a Research Log


### What is a research log?
A research log is an informal way of documenting your research progress. It is an effective way to keep track of your databases searches as well as your notes on sources. Research logs are useful because they track your progress, store your notes, and encourage you to be reflective on your research and reading.

Research logs may take many formats, but a successful research log will contain three related parts:
* A record of database searches
* Source notes
* An annotated bibliography


### Record of database searches
Keep track of each database search:
* Date
* Database
* Search terms
* Search limits (if applicable)
* Results


### Source notes
Take careful notes on each source:
* Complete citation
* Summary (in your own words)
* Evaluation
* Relationship to other sources
* Notes


### Annotated bibliography
What is an annotated bibliography?

An annotated bibliography is like a regular bibliography except that it also includes a brief summary (and possibly an evaluation) for each item. 


### Tools for your research log
* Paper and pen
* Note taking app
    * Evernote
    * One Note
